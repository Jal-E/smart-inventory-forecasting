# Smart Inventory Forecasting & Anomaly Detection for Retail Supply Chains

This project forecasts SKU-level retail demand and flags inventory anomalies using real-world Walmart M5 data. It includes XGBoost and LSTM-based models, anomaly detection, and a Streamlit dashboard.

## Structure
- `/data`: Raw and processed datasets
- `/notebooks`: EDA and modeling notebooks
- `/src`: Scripts for feature engineering, models, and anomaly detection
- `/models`: Saved models
- `/visuals`: Graphs and evaluation plots
- `/dashboard`: Streamlit app for user interaction

⚠️ Due to GitHub size limits, please download `sales_train_validation.csv` and `sell_prices.csv` from [Kaggle M5 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/m5-forecasting-accuracy/data) and place them in `/data/`.
